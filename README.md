# Netflix Container

**Prevent Netflix from tracking your visits to other websites**

This is a fork of [Facebook Container](https://github.com/mozilla/contain-facebook), and [Contain Google](https://github.com/containers-everywhere/contain-google).

Netflix Container is an add-on you can install on Firefox to prevent Netflix from tracking your activity on other websites, so you can continue to use Netflix while protecting your privacy.

**Note:** To learn more about Containers in general, see [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers).

## How does Netflix Container work?

The Add-on keeps Netflix in a separate Container to prevent it from following your activity on other websites. When you first install the add-on, it signs you out of Netflix and deletes the cookies that Netflix uses to track you on other websites. 

Every time you visit Netflix, it will open in its own container, separate from other websites you visit.  You can login to Netflix within its container.  When browsing outside the container, Netflix won’t be able to easily collect your browsing data and connect it to your Netflix identity.

## How do I enable Netflix Container?

We’ve made it easy to take steps to protect your privacy so you can go on with your day.

1. [Install Netflix Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/netflix-container/). This will log you out of Netflix and delete the cookies it’s been using to track you.
2. Open Netflix and use it like you normally would.  Firefox will automatically switch to the Netflix Container tab for you.
3. If you click on a link to a page outside of Netflix or type in another website in the address bar, Firefox will load them outside of the Netflix Container

## How does this affect Netflix’s features?

Netflix Containers prevents Netflix from linking your activity on other websites to your Netflix identity. Therefore, the following will not work:

### “Like” buttons and embedded Netflix comments on other websites.

Because you are logged into Netflix only in the Container, “Like” buttons and embedded Netflix comments on other websites will not work.

### Logging in or creating accounts on other websites using Netflix

Websites that allow you to create an account or log in using Netflix will generally not work properly.

## Will this protect me from Netflix completely?

This add-on does not prevent Netflix from mishandling the data it already has or permitted others to obtain about you. Netflix still will have access to everything that you do while you are on Netflix.com or on any Netflix app, including your Netflix comments, photo uploads, likes, and any data you share with Netflix connected apps, etc.  

Other ad networks may try to link your Netflix activities with your regular browsing. In addition to this add-on, there are other things you can do to maximize your protection, including changing your Netflix settings, using Private Browsing and Tracking Protection, blocking third-party cookies, and/or using [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/ ) extension to further limit tracking.

## How do I use Containers for other websites?

Good news! Containers aren’t just for Netflix. You can use Containers to prevent websites from linking your identities across the Web by installing [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/).
